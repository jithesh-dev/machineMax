# Machine Max Coding Test

The project was build in React without using the create-react-app.

### How to Run :

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm start` in the root directory

### Design :

1. Layout created by following BEM approach
2. Used scss to implement basic layout
3. Used MaterialUI elements for Icons and Form Elements

### Additional Features :

1. Login validation for wrong credentials
2. Local storage of user to retain user session
3. Logout feature

### Challenges :

1. Since no designs were provided, had to spend some time of UI design
2. Lack of time to implement production level concepts.

### Things to improve if I had more time :

1. Started the project in a TDD approach or implemented tests using Jest after the main functionalities
2. Declared Environment variables instead of hardcoding the config data
3. Rearranged imports in alphabetical order
4. Implement infinite scrolling in Albums details page
5. Optimize image loading time using skeletons
6. Used redux for storing Album details for a logged in user rather than hitting API again when navigating back to home page
7. Used custom hooks for Infinite loading
8. More code spliting can be done on a component level
9. Improve UI and added transitions
10. Regular Git commits and splitting features into branches
